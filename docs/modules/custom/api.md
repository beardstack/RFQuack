Every module extends the following interface, which exposes a series of hooking points to tap into the data-processing pipeline.

By overriding these hooks, you can change how each I/O packet is sent to the subsequent step:

- `onPacketReceived`
- `afterPacketReceived`
- `onLoop`
- `executeUserCommand`
- `start`
- `set`

        // here you can setup internal variables.
    }

    bool onPacketReceived(rfquack_Packet &pkt, rfquack_WhichRadio whichRadio) override {
       // onPacketReceived() is called when a packet is captured.
       // This method is called by the driver itself; you should use this method
       // for tasks which should be performed as soon as a packet is received.

       // If this method returns 'true' the packet is passed to the next module.
       // If this method returns 'false' the packet is dropped and no further
       // calls to modules will be performed.
       // If every module returns 'true' then the packet gets stored in memory.

       // Note: This method is called only if the module is enabled.

       // It you don't plan to use this hook, you can remove this method and stop extending OnPacketReceived

      // internal RX queue.
      // Here you should perform non-time-sensitive tasks as well as packet
      // modifications, retransmissions etc.

      // If this method returns 'true' the packet is passed to the next module.
      // If this method returns 'false' the packet is dropped and no further
      // calls to modules will be performed.
